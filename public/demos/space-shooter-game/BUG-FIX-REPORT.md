# Space Shooter Game - Bug Fix Report

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Asset Path 404s** - Lines 79, 260, 299, 317, 335 in three-game.js
   - Hardcoded relative paths missing `./` prefix
   - Paths: `assets/skybox/`, `assets/space-kit/Models/GLTF format/*.glb`
   - Result: Browser fails to load models and skybox

2. **Sound Path 404s** - Lines 57, 61 in three-game.js
   - Missing `./` prefix on sound file paths
   - Paths: `Sounds-Music/Shots & Explosions/*.mp3`
   - Result: Audio fails to load silently

3. **Script Loading Path Error** - Line 199 in index.html
   - Absolute path `/demos/space-shooter-game/three-game.js` breaks portability
   - Should use relative path `./three-game.js`
   - Result: Script fails to load in some hosting scenarios

4. **Missing Renderer Visibility Config** - Lines 40-44 in three-game.js
   - No sRGB color space enabled
   - No tone mapping configured
   - Result: Ships and projectiles appear too dark

5. **Player Position Reset Bug** - Line 889 in three-game.js
   - Reset to (0,0,0) instead of forward position (0,0,5)
   - Result: Player invisible after restart until moved

6. **Pixel Ratio Cap** - Line 43 in three-game.js
   - Capped at 2.0, should be 1.75 for better mobile performance
   - Result: Excessive GPU load on high-DPI displays

- Resize handler: Already implemented at lines 841-846
- Mobile controls: Already implemented with touch support
- HUD elements: All IDs already exist in HTML

## Testing Checklist

Run these tests after starting dev server (`pnpm run dev`):

1. ✓ **Start without console errors** - Navigate to game, check console
2. ✓ **No 404s** - Network tab shows all assets load (200 status)
3. ✓ **Player visible** - Ship appears on screen after character selection
4. ✓ **Movement works** - Arrow keys move player left/right
5. ✓ **Fire works** - Spacebar shoots visible projectiles
6. ✓ **Enemies spawn** - Red ships appear and move toward player
7. ✓ **HUD updates** - Score/lives/level display and update correctly
8. ✓ **Pause works** - ESC pauses game, ESC again resumes
9. ✓ **Restart works** - Restart button resets game state properly
10. ✓ **Resize OK** - Browser window resize adjusts canvas correctly

## Performance Expectations

- LCP < 1.8s on mobile
- FPS: 60fps on desktop, 30-60fps on mobile
- No memory leaks during extended play
- Smooth gameplay without stuttering
